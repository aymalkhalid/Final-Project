<h1>Real Time Charts</h1>
<p>
	A chart can be static, in the sense that there are no changes in its appearance while it is displayed, or it can be dynamic, reacting to user actions or external data feeds or both. A static chart, as the name implies, will not change once it is drawn: it is a snapshot of a given system.
